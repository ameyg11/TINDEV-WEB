this is the front-end part of the TinDev Social media platform once created completely I'll give all the details with hoisted link !!


to do bugs
 => add the toast after saving profile or error occured

 => solve  the bug of user data just after signup
        -> when a user signs up and redirects to profile then he doesn't see the firstName and lastName etc in the input section
           but when he refreshes the page the data comes 

=> gender {EditProfile.jsx:67 Profile update error: ValidationError: gender: Gender data is not valid}
        -> before selecting the default id not setting as MALe of anything 

=> user is seeing his own profile
        -> I think it is handled in API but ......... 
        -> see { ameyg11@gmail.com      pass- Ameygawade@11  }  profile


=> just take some time and see the whole code and then start deployment
        -> review each code
